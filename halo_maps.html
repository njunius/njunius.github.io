The original design was much larger and had round corridors but due to various limitations with the tool and platform, the map became incredibly compact and needed other ways of breaking up sight lines, large pillars that extended between the top and middle floors of the map. Two elements made it all the way through the design and implementation process: the three floor structure and the ability to quickly move from the bottom to the top, and vice versa.</div>

                    <div class = "info">My penultimate multiplayer oriented Forge project, this map grew out of my interest in building something on the less commonly used parts of Forge World (the game's canvas environment). This led to a broadly symmetrical map with some minor variations on each side to accommodate the different base geometry of the environment. This map also happens to be the one that went through the most radical change during its development, moving from using the pre-fabricated buildings to the final, custom made, angular structures. One side effect of this change was the buildings themselves getting larger and having more ways of moving between floors.</div>
