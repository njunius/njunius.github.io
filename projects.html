                    <div class = "info">Puppitor is a theatrically inspired digital game interface written in python designed around giving players and AI behaviors control of a character's physicality during a conversation. Its core features revolve around mapping buttons to different designer authorable actions and the creation of character specific rules governing how performing each action changes a character's currently expressed emotional state. This emotional state and set of actions can then be used to alter the character's gestures, facial expressions, color palette, background music, and other in game elements.</div>

                        <div class = "info">Michael Gunning, Nick Junius, Chaiz Tuimoloau<br>We made this GameMaker side-scrolling shooter as a silly, slightly more narrative leaning game when compared to <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contra_(video_game)">Contra</a>. We included between-mission "codec calls" as the most obvious way of delivering the narrative. We used a similar random weapon drop system to other games in the genre with two notable exceptions: weapons are consistently dropped by specific enemies and rather than a pistol with unlimited ammunition, players' fallback weapon is their fists. If you want to play the game yourself and have a Windows machine, click the game's title. If you want to watch a playthrough: <a href = "https://youtu.be/cFEPPFtXZK0">click here</a>.</div>

                        <div class = "info">Michael Gunning, Nick Junius, Chaiz Tuimoloau<br>We made this top-down ImpactJS game as a very rough attempt at mashing Doom and Dark Souls together into something we could make in a few weeks. What the game wound up becoming was much more of a classic top-down adventure game, complete with combat that only allowed for four-directional movement and deciding whether you were attacking or spacing yourself out against enemies. Click the game's title if you want to play but note that if you have a high refresh rate monitor the game speed will be significantly faster than intended and the main menu may be difficult to navigate.</div>

While the story is inspired by certain parts of military science-fiction, I tried to inject some cosmic horror into its short read time. Somewhat intentionally, Inure's story is connected to this game and if you want to be generous you might call Inure the sequel.</div>

Nick Whitlow<br>One of my small cast, near single setting stories that centers on a group of soldiers trapped in a building and forced to reckon with their identities as tensions mount. One of my main interests in writing this script was the responses different people have to their perception of self being challenged. Sometimes we embrace this and sometimes we violently push back and in doing so reveal about ourselves than we normally would.</div>

Kieran Beccia<br>This play focuses on three characters each vying for control over each others' lives and the different personas they use in the contest. I tried to keep the kernal of what the play was about as ambiguous as possible in the script to allow for productions to fill in those details themselves. With that said, there is still an eye towards issues of mental health inherent in the script.</div>

                    <div class = "info">I wrote this little thread in response to a prompt to make a piece of digital art as a gift that could not be given. With the amount of time I'd spent making maps in various Halo Forge tools, I knew I wanted to revisit that environment in some way. Quite unintentionally this little project added layers and layers onto my response to the prompt. Originally this was just supposed to be something I couldn't give my past self but due to the game I was using being a decade old, I couldn't give my current self the video I'd recorded because the online rendering utility had long since been disconnected. So the Twitter poem I found myself with wound up being a little, fleeting reminder of how so much of the work I'd done early on in my life was lost as technology moved on. <a href = "gift_archival_ver.html">HTML Archival Version</a></div>
