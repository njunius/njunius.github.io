                        Puppitor is a theatrically inspired digital game interface written in Python designed around giving players and AI behaviors control of a character's physicality during a conversation. Its core features revolve around mapping buttons to different designer authorable actions and the creation of character specific rules governing how performing each action changes a character's currently expressed emotional state. This emotional state and set of actions can then be used to alter the character's gestures, facial expressions, color palette, background music, and other in game elements. My C# port of the library can be found <a href = "https://github.com/njunius/Puppitor-C-Sharp">here</a>.

                            Ghost Engines is a science-fiction mecha tabletop role playing game and wargame created for hex grids. The game features simultaneous turns, combined arms warfare, terrain deformation, and extensive construction systems for everything from infantry to mechs. Ghost Engines is playable either as a tournament style wargame or a narrative focused role playing experience. I am primarily responsible for the design of the construction systems, the damage system, network area, weapons, and much of the available equipment. Ghost Engines is still in development and we are looking forward to a full release including campaign rules and additional setting details.</div>

                            Telegrams from the Choir Train is an experimental narrative game played via Discord bot. Players take on the role of telegraph operators managing the cargo of a train while the Discord bot provides the interface and state tracking. In addition to buying and selling orders, players receive bits of text such as newspaper articles, diary entries, and other bits of story in real time. I was responsible for planning and writing the first story arc for Rikke, a young member of the Salvation Church sent to witness the Inauguration of a new Channeller. What would otherwise have been a joyous occasion becomes the catalyst for her learning far more about the world than she ever wanted to know.</div>

Set after Unto the Night and significantly before Homeward in the Roil, the plot is centered on an admiral, the same admiral as makes an appearance in the latter story, asking the three golems to deliver her a victory to avoid further loss of life on both sides of the battle. I'll just say that things turn out unlike anyone, especially the golems, expect.

This story is set long before its predecessor, before space travel was even a thought. The golems are tasked with an assassination under impossible conditions with barely any equipment. Not only are they given an absurd task, their bodies are fighting them every step of the way. This story contains many of my thoughts about having life saving surgery and being pressed back to work as I recovered.</div>

There is an emphasis on navigating interpersonal relationships between students and advisors in many of the scenarios.

                            Unto the Night is a <a href = "http://twinery.org/">Twine</a> project that began life as a rewrite of Breach (see below). The aesthetic inspiration for this story came from the military science-fiction I grew up reading and playing. Like its original version cosmic horror crops up more and more as the story goes on, though with a much more, dare I say, positive view of the cosmic entities than the previous iteration. This slightly more positive attitude may also be thanks to the object in the story's cover art developing a cult following while I was working on it (thank you <a href = "https://twitter.com/isaackarth">Isaac</a>). Again like this story's predecessor, Unto the Night's plot is related to Inure's mainly through time, place, and fallout, rather than character.</div>

                            Michael Gunning, Nic Junius (as Nick Junius), Chaiz Tuimoloau<br>We made this GameMaker side-scrolling shooter as a silly, slightly more narrative leaning game when compared to <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contra_(video_game)">Contra</a>. We included between-mission "codec calls" as the most obvious way of delivering the narrative. We used a similar random weapon drop system to other games in the genre with two notable exceptions: weapons are consistently dropped by specific enemies and rather than a pistol with unlimited ammunition, players' fallback weapon is their fists.

                            Michael Gunning, Nic Junius (as Nick Junius), Chaiz Tuimoloau<br>We made this top-down ImpactJS game to be a fantasy themed shooter as something we could make in a few weeks. What the game wound up becoming was much more of a classic top-down adventure game, complete with combat that only allowed for four-directional movement and deciding whether you were attacking or spacing yourself out against enemies. Click the game's title if you want to play but note that if you have a high refresh rate monitor the game speed will be significantly faster than intended and the main menu may be difficult to navigate.</div>

                        With the amount of time I'd spent making maps in various Halo Forge tools, I knew I wanted to revisit that environment in some way. Quite unintentionally this little project added layers and layers onto my response to the prompt. Originally this was just supposed to be something I couldn't give my past self but due to the game I was using being a decade old, I couldn't give my current self the video I'd recorded because the online rendering utility had long since been disconnected. So the Twitter poem I found myself with wound up being a little, fleeting reminder of how so much of the work I'd done early on in my life was lost as technology moved on. <a href = "gift_archival_ver.html">HTML Archival Version</a>.</div>

                        I began making custom maps in Halo 3 once the first "canvas" map (Foundry) was released and with it the ability to edit something resembling geometry, even if it was at the end of the day just a bunch of crates being used in increasingly creative ways. Once Halo: Reach came out I'd spent enough time messing around in the tool and with the game mechanics to add more polish to the projects, including getting deeper into the respawning system the game used.</div>

Nick Whitlow<br>One of my small cast, near single setting stories that centers on a group of soldiers trapped in a building and forced to reckon with their identities as tensions mount. One of my main interests in writing this script was the responses different people have to their perception of self being challenged. Sometimes we embrace this and sometimes we violently push back and in doing so reveal more about ourselves than we normally would.</div>

Kieran Beccia<br>This play focuses on three characters each vying for control over each others' lives and the different personas they use in the contest. I tried to keep the kernel of what the play was about as ambiguous as possible in the script to allow for productions to fill in those details themselves. With that said, there is still an eye towards issues of mental health inherent in the script.</div>
