                        Puppitor is a theatrically inspired digital game interface written in Python designed around giving players and AI behaviors control of a character's physicality during a conversation. Its core features revolve around mapping buttons to different designer authorable actions and the creation of character specific rules governing how performing each action changes a character's currently expressed emotional state. This emotional state and set of actions can then be used to alter the character's gestures, facial expressions, color palette, background music, and other in game elements. My C# port of the library can be found <a href = "https://github.com/njunius/Puppitor-C-Sharp">here</a>.

                            Homeward in the Roil is a <a href = "http://twinery.org/">Twine</a> project collaboration set in the same universe as Unto the Night and One Attempt for the Future, though much later in the timeline. The story deals with the trauma of losing someplace to call home and finding connection across different cultures, and ultimately finding love and belonging in the middle of chaos and uncertainty. I advised on setting details as well as designed the Twine layout and structure to convert the story into interactive fiction.</div>

                            One Attempt for the Future is a <a href = "http://twinery.org/">Twine</a> project that began life as a rewrite of Fear thy Nature (see below) and is officially the mark of the beginning of the anthology series titled "Mourner's Kaddish for Golems" (also containing Unto the Night). This story is set long before its predecessor, before space travel was even a thought. The golems are tasked with an assassination under impossible conditions with barely any equipment. Not only are they given an absurd task, their bodies are fighting them every step of the way. This story contains many of my thoughts about having life saving surgery and being pressed back to work as I recovered.</div>

There is an emphasis on navigating interpersonal relationships between students and advisors in many of the scenarios.

                            Unto the Night is a <a href = "http://twinery.org/">Twine</a> project that began life as a rewrite of Breach (see below). The aesthetic inspiration for this story came from the military science-fiction I grew up reading and playing. Like its original version cosmic horror crops up more and more as the story goes on, though with a much more, dare I say, positive view of the cosmic entities than the previous iteration. This slightly more positive attitude may also be thanks to the object in the story's cover art developing a cult following while I was working on it (thank you <a href = "https://twitter.com/isaackarth">Isaac</a>). Again like this story's predecessor, Unto the Night's plot is related to Inure's mainly through time, place, and fallout, rather than character.</div>

                            One of my early projects built in <a href = "http://twinery.org/">Twine</a> that tells short, branching story about a group of soldiers sent to investigate some strange happenings in a remote star system. While the story is inspired by certain parts of military science-fiction, I tried to inject some cosmic horror into its short read time. Somewhat intentionally, Inure's story is connected to this game and if you want to be generous you might call Inure the sequel.

                            Michael Gunning, Nick Junius, Chaiz Tuimoloau<br>We made this GameMaker side-scrolling shooter as a silly, slightly more narrative leaning game when compared to <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contra_(video_game)">Contra</a>. We included between-mission "codec calls" as the most obvious way of delivering the narrative. We used a similar random weapon drop system to other games in the genre with two notable exceptions: weapons are consistently dropped by specific enemies and rather than a pistol with unlimited ammunition, players' fallback weapon is their fists.

                        With the amount of time I'd spent making maps in various Halo Forge tools, I knew I wanted to revisit that environment in some way. Quite unintentionally this little project added layers and layers onto my response to the prompt. Originally this was just supposed to be something I couldn't give my past self but due to the game I was using being a decade old, I couldn't give my current self the video I'd recorded because the online rendering utility had long since been disconnected. So the Twitter poem I found myself with wound up being a little, fleeting reminder of how so much of the work I'd done early on in my life was lost as technology moved on. <a href = "gift_archival_ver.html">HTML Archival Version</a>.</div>

                        I began making custom maps in Halo 3 once the first "canvas" map (Foundry) was released and with it the ability to edit something resembling geometry, even if it was at the end of the day just a bunch of crates being used in increasingly creative ways. Once Halo: Reach came out I'd spent enough time messing around in the tool and with the game mechanics to add more polish to the projects, including getting deeper into the respawning system the game used.</div>

Nick Whitlow<br>One of my small cast, near single setting stories that centers on a group of soldiers trapped in a building and forced to reckon with their identities as tensions mount. One of my main interests in writing this script was the responses different people have to their perception of self being challenged. Sometimes we embrace this and sometimes we violently push back and in doing so reveal more about ourselves than we normally would.</div>

Kieran Beccia<br>This play focuses on three characters each vying for control over each others' lives and the different personas they use in the contest. I tried to keep the kernel of what the play was about as ambiguous as possible in the script to allow for productions to fill in those details themselves. With that said, there is still an eye towards issues of mental health inherent in the script.</div>
