Sword-
A generic longsword that appeared in your hand when you arrived in this strange place. What more do you want? It's a sword, not ornate or
awe inspiring, but well engineered. The blade is balanced quite nicely, and what it lacks in reach, it makes up for in weight and finesse.

Solearm-
This massive spear of steel feels well worn, possibly by those who may have come before you, possibly by the inhabitants of this world.
However, no other weapon your enemies wield bears a resemblance to it. In spite of its weathered appearance, the Solearm is still as lethal 
as the day it was forged. While not as suitable for dealing with massive crowds, its reach alone allows more uses than one might initially
think.

Warhammer-
This mass of steel and wood is stained with the blood of the many enemies it has felled, and more than a few of its masters. 
A single swing will send foes reeling, if not outright obliterating them, but each swing requires considerable effort to make.

Lancethrower-
A hulking crossbow-like instrument of death, the Lancethrower sends metallic rods hundreds of feet in the blink of an eye and through
practically any foe one might face. Unfortunately its great power impedes its rate of fire, forcing the wielder to carefully plan their
shots, as a single miss may in fact claim them, as it has with so many before you.

Repeating Rifle- 
This highly advanced weapon seems almost out of place in this world, and for good reason, no other weapon encountered can launch such a 
steady hail of death from its muzzel. The small metallic balls it launches will hardly scratch a foe's armor alone, but when spat forth
from this deadly weapon, few will survive. To achieve its obscene rate of fire, much of its range has been sacrificed, forcing its 
wielder to get closer to foes than with the Lancethrower.
