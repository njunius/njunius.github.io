            <p>This was originally an essay I wrote to apply to PhD programs and has been lightly edited.</p>

            <p>There are some things about my life that are too on the nose to put into a story, and I say that as someone whose research involves writing stories. This is a little bit of the story of how I managed to be in the position where it took moving into an actual closet for me to understand myself (in spite of growing up in San Francisco, queer haven that it has been) and how that experience has influenced my research priorities and what stories I choose to tell with my work.</p>

            <p>I did not go to a public school until high school. While it was still the late 90s and early 2000s when I was in K-8 and queer visibility wasn't what it is today, I probably would not have taken so long to understand my own gender bullshit were it not for the private school I went to. This school was one of those "jump into the Ivy League pipeline" kinds of places that mainly catered to rich people (like own the Golden State Warriors levels of rich). Also it was an all-boys school.</p>

            <p>So I go to this school not thinking about gender at all but definitely thinking things like "I want to grow my hair out" and then running face first into the "keep your hair off of your collar" rule. They were teaching us to be <i>gentlemen</i> after all and a <i>gentleman</i> wears <i>his</i> hair short. They didn't ever to my knowledge cut anyone's hair themselves but there were constant reprimands about it, all in the service of turning us into young <i>men</i>. The cis and heterosexual part wasn't ever explicitly stated but then again it wasn't an environment that acknowledged the existence of gay people let alone trans and non-binary folks. This stuff (other than the hair thing) wasn't especially hardcore during kindergarten through fourth grade so anything I may have subconsciously been thinking about gender wasn't on their radar either.</p>

            <p>Fifth through eighth grade was when things got worse. Some of it was because just that's when puberty gets going, and for me at least, the general feeling of "wow I really don't want this to happen in this way" got stronger. This was also when a lot of the more subtle things about how the school enforced and perpetuated a lot of gender essentialism and compulsory heterosexuality. We were forced once a week during fifth or sixth grade to get dressed up and learn how to ballroom dance (only as boys of course) with some of the other single gender schools in the city. The thing that sticks with me the most from my time there was getting into apparently serious trouble with some of the administrators there because I was accused of doing <i>something</i> deviating from the extremely cis, heterosexual standards they wanted us all to follow. I still don't know what I was actually accused of. I only remember sitting in an administrator's office crying because I didn't know what was happening or why. Later I heard a rumor that someone in a grade above mine was the one who had actually done whatever the administrators were upset about and somehow thrown me under the bus.</p>

            <p>I still don't know if I can articulate all of what that experience did. The gist of it is that all those constant thoughts of "god I want to be anything other than a boy" were never talked about with anyone for about ten years after I finally got out of that school. That isn't to say I didn't have people around I <i>could</i> have talked to about things, I had queer friends in high school (it was San Francisco after all) but all those experiences I'd had before meant I was absolutely terrified of talking to anyone about what I was actually feeling and a lot of my thought process at that point was "what they are saying can't possibly apply to me" and that way of thinking stuck around for all of my time as an undergrad.</p>

            <p>A combination of a few different events plus just being so far removed from that school finally convinced me to explore my identity and talk with other people about what I'd been feeling for a very long time. One of these events was simply going to graduate school (and moving into a closet). Another important decision I made was joining a Discord server with a very large queer population and no connection to my real life. Graduate school more than anything got me doing work I enjoyed and once again found myself with queer friends. Joining the Discord server provided me a very private way to finally experiment with certain kinds of presentation and also be around other queer people talking quite candidly about how they were feeling which, again, really helped bleed off the remaining personal fears I had about talking to people about who I was.</p>

            <p>A large part of my research practice involves storytelling and the stories I write tend to focus at least in some degree on struggles about identity and self-perception (in no small part thanks to what I've been writing about for this application). It is my hope that the stories I tell can provide comfort, catharsis, understanding, revelation, or something else to other queer people who may not have the support I now am lucky enough to have. With the tools and technical approaches that are a part of my research I hope I can make some of the more experimental aspects of interactive narrative more accessible and allow others, especially other queer people, to tell their own stories and recontextualize games they play beyond just reinterpretation. Teaching has been a near constant in my life and one of the things most important to me, especially now, is providing students opportunities to explore their self expression with their own work and help them navigate being vulnerable with what they make.</p>

            <p>I have written three essays like this one while applying to universities and it is only now that I was able to really talk about my past experiences this openly. The plays I've written only really make sense to me in retrospect and are in many ways very public, if veiled, versions of what I'm writing about here. My ultimate hope is to give people, queer people especially, more tools to express themselves, both literally and figuratively.</p>

            <p>I've decided to put this essay up in a semi-public way because of what I have been seeing happening in the UK and what is now coming back to the US. If these laws and beliefs are allowed to grow, there will be more kids with stories like mine and not all of them will make it through the extreme pain inflicted upon them. It took me about a decade's remove from what I experienced growing up to be able to actually realize who I was after having it so thoroughly crushed beneath adults' heels. It took me over a decade to be willing to be public about who I was in any way off of the internet. I never want to hear of another child having to go through anything remotely like what I have experienced, let alone the countless stories far worse. If me putting this up on the internet helps even one person I can be happy. I want to pay forward as much as I can and I hope this little story does that in even a small way.</p>
