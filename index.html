                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>I'm a Computational Media PhD candidate in the Interaction Dynamics Lab at UC Santa Cruz. I was previously a <a href = "https://danm.ucsc.edu/">Digital Arts and New Media</a> MFA student and an MS student in the <a href = "https://eis.ucsc.edu/">Expressive Intelligence Studio</a> also at UC Santa Cruz. I primarily study computational models of character interaction and theatrical practice. At the moment my work is focused on building interfaces and interaction models to facilitate new kinds of expressiveness between players and characters in digital games. Much of the inspiration for the modeling approaches I use is drawn from acting and directing practice in theater as well as <a href = "https://adamsmith.as/papers/caricatures.pdf">computational caricature</a> with the goal of making approachable, customizable systems for interactive narrative projects. Please visit my <a href = "https://quakefultales.itch.io/">itch.io</a> page for the official pages of my released games.</p>

                        Puppitor is a theatrically inspired digital game interface written in Python designed around giving players and AI behaviors control of a character's physicality during a conversation. Its core features revolve around mapping buttons to different designer authorable actions and the creation of character specific rules governing how performing each action changes a character's currently expressed emotional state. This emotional state and set of actions can then be used to alter the character's gestures, facial expressions, color palette, background music, and other in game elements. My C# port of the library can be found <a href = "https://github.com/njunius/Puppitor-C-Sharp">here</a>.

                            One Attempt for the Future is a <a href = "http://twinery.org/">Twine</a> project that began life as a rewrite of Fear thy Nature (see <a href = "projects.html">Projects</a>) and is officially the mark of the beginning of the anthology series titled "Mourner's Kaddish for Golems" (also containing Unto the Night). This story is set long before its predecessor, before space travel was even a thought. The golems are tasked with an assassination under impossible conditions with barely any equipment. Not only are they given an absurd task, their bodies are fighting them every step of the way. This story contains many of my thoughts about having life saving surgery and being pressed back to work as I recovered.</div>
