                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>I am a narrative designer at CCP Games where I am helping craft universes for players to uncover the secrets of. I have a PhD in Computational Media PhD from the <a href = "https://www.interactiondynamicslab.com/">Interaction Dynamics Lab</a> at UC Santa Cruz. I previously received an MFA in <a href = "https://danm.ucsc.edu/">Digital Arts and New Media</a> in 2021 and an MS in Computational Media from the <a href = "https://eis.ucsc.edu/">Expressive Intelligence Studio</a> in 2019, both from UC Santa Cruz. My research focuses on computational models of character interaction and theatrical practice and building interfaces and interaction models to facilitate new kinds of expressiveness between players and characters in digital games. Much of the inspiration for the modeling approaches I use is drawn from acting and directing practice in theater as well as <a href = "https://adamsmith.as/papers/caricatures.pdf">computational caricature</a> with the goal of making approachable, customizable systems for interactive narrative projects. Please visit my <a href = "https://quakefultales.itch.io/">itch.io</a> page for the official pages of my released games.</p>

                        Puppitor is a theatrically inspired digital game interface written in Python designed around giving players and AI behaviors control of a character's physicality during a conversation. Its core features revolve around mapping buttons to different designer authorable actions and the creation of character specific rules governing how performing each action changes a character's currently expressed emotional state. This emotional state and set of actions can then be used to alter the character's gestures, facial expressions, color palette, background music, and other in game elements. My C# port of the library can be found <a href = "https://github.com/njunius/Puppitor-C-Sharp">here</a>.

Set after Unto the Night and significantly before Homeward in the Roil, the plot is centered on an admiral, the same admiral as makes an appearance in the latter story, asking the three golems to deliver her a victory to avoid further loss of life on both sides of the battle. I'll just say that things turn out unlike anyone, especially the golems, expect.
