                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>I'm a <a href = "https://danm.ucsc.edu/">Digital Arts and New Media</a> MFA student at UC Santa Cruz, previously an MS student in the <a href = "https://eis.ucsc.edu/">Expressive Intelligence Studio</a>, studying computational models of character interaction and theatrical practice. At the moment my work is focused on building interfaces and interaction models to facilitate new kinds of expressiveness between players and characters in digital games. Much of the inspiration for the modeling approaches I use is drawn from acting and directing practice in theater as well as <a href = "https://adamsmith.as/papers/caricatures.pdf">computational caricature</a> with the goal of making approachable, customizable systems for interactive narrative projects. Please visit my <a href = "https://quakefultales.itch.io/">itch.io</a> page for the official pages of my released games.</p>

                    <div class = "info">Puppitor is a theatrically inspired digital game interface written in python designed around giving players and AI behaviors control of a character's physicality during a conversation. Its core features revolve around mapping buttons to different designer authorable actions and the creation of character specific rules governing how performing each action changes a character's currently expressed emotional state. This emotional state and set of actions can then be used to alter the character's gestures, facial expressions, color palette, background music, and other in game elements.</div>

Nick Whitlow<br>One of my small cast, near single setting stories that centers on a group of soldiers trapped in a building and forced to reckon with their identities as tensions mount. One of my main interests in writing this script was the responses different people have to their perception of self being challenged. Sometimes we embrace this and sometimes we violently push back and in doing so reveal about ourselves than we normally would.</div>

Kieran Beccia<br>This play focuses on three characters each vying for control over each others' lives and the different personas they use in the contest. I tried to keep the kernal of what the play was about as ambiguous as possible in the script to allow for productions to fill in those details themselves. With that said, there is still an eye towards issues of mental health inherent in the script.</div>

The structure was mainly focused around a bi-weekly writing workshop style classroom where students would bring in progress work to be read out loud by their peers or myself followed by a discussion and critique of what was read. I also scheduled time for group playthroughs of narrative focused games to give students a better idea of some of the variety in kinds of projects they might find themselves on.</div>
