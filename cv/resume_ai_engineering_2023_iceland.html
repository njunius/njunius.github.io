                    <div class = "section">
                        During my time as a doctoral researcher I have managed and been a team member on multiple research projects, both large and small scale. I directed and managed a team of four writers and was responsible for the completion of seven individual episodes, all delivered on time within the span of three months. I have led multiple game projects with varying numbers of collaborators and am used to providing direction and offering flexibility in how tasks are completed while maintaining a coherent high level vision of each project. My most recent job as an AI engineer has been a collaboration with the Honda Research Institute and Northwestern University, requiring a large amount of coordination across teams and different engineering disciplines as well as independence to pursue developing new features and capabilities for software deliverables.
                        <br><br>
                        Beyond my time as a system designer and engineer, I am an avid theatergoer who has also worked on four theater productions, two as a playwright and two as a lighting designer. My time as a playwright in particular has made me take joy in the creativity that comes with collaboration and seeing what colleagues with expertise different from my own will add to my work.
